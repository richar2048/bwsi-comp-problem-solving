    "Supervised learning is a paradigm that requires a labeled dataset to train on. It trains algorithms to map from input data to desired output data based on how the data is labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "A handwriting reader algorithm would be a good application for supervised learning. The labeled data would be images of handwritten text that are labeled with the literal text written. The algorithm would then learn to read handwriting by inputing images, guessing the text, and then changing the model based on whether or not it guessed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning paradigms are generally used for classification (think classifying images) or regression (for example, prediction of ocean levels from historical data). In a sentence, supervised learning creates a function that connects data to its labels."

    "Unsupervised learning is a framework in which algorithms associate and categorize unlabaled data. It is used for more complex tasks than supervised learning. Instead of mapping from data to labels, it independently finds patterns in unlabeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models are trained by having the model attempt to copy input data, then changing the model so that its outputs more closely match the inputs. For a model that generates text, input text would be fed in, and the model would be changed based on how closely its output matched the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this framework doesn't require labels, it can identify and exptrapolate more complex relationships from a dataset. It finds whatever associations and connections that exist in the data and mimics them.\n",

    "## Deep Learning\n",
    "Neural networks are learning models that consist of multiple layers of artificial neurons. They are called deep learning models because they have a larger number of layers of artificial neurons, giving the model 'depth'. Every neural layer of the network is supposed to give the algorithm more room to abstract from the training data. The intention of the design is that each layer adds a level of dimensionality to the model. For image recognition, the first layer might take individual pixels for input and output lines, the next layer might output shapes, and the next might output categories such as square or circle. \n",

    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a paradigm in which the model does a kind of cost-benefit learning to improve. Certain behavior will be 'rewarded' and other behavior 'punished'. This is done by giving certain behaviors a numerical score. For example, a model that is training a walking robot would have a reward for going a farther distance, and be punished for falling over. Because they do not outright prohibit unwanted behavior, they can develop behavior that is more adaptable to complex environments than supervised methods while still being more goal-driven than unsupervised methods. \n",
